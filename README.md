## 🔍 Why I Built This
I wanted a personal AI that feels like a real digital companion — voice-first, smart, curious, and capable of controlling media and my computer naturally. Not another chatbot webpage, but something that lives on my desktop, listens constantly, and actually helps me manage tasks hands-free.

From building the voice engine to a modular skill layer, I wanted the freedom to extend functionality — while keeping everything offline and private.
